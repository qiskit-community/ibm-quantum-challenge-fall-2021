Battery storage systems have provided a solution to flexibly integrate large-scale renewable energy in a power system. The performance of a battery decreases while it is used, so you need to consider the degradation of each battery for figuring out the optimal battery scheduling. In this challenge, you are asked to optimize the battery revenue using a quantum computer and find the lowest circuit cost and circuit depth.

**Problem:** Solve the battery revenue optimization problem with the lowest circuit cost and circuit depth. Achieve better accuracy with smaller circuits. You can receive a badge for solving all the challenge exercises up to 4b. In addition, you can obtain a score with ranking by solving the last exercise 4c in this challenge.

**Level:** Advanced
