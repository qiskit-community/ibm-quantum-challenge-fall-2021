    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a technology that has attracted a great deal of attention due to its high performance and versatility. In fact, it has been put to practical use in many industries with the recent development of algorithms and the increase of computational resources. A typical example is computer vision, where machine learning is now able to classify images with the same or better accuracy than humans. For example, the ability to automatically classify clothing images has made online shopping for clothes more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of quantum computation to machine learning has recently been shown to have the potential for even greater capabilities. Various algorithms have been proposed for quantum machine learning, such as the quantum support vector machine (QSVM) and quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs). In this challenge, you will use QSVM to tackle the clothing image classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "QSVM is a quantum version of the support vector machine (SVM), a classical machine learning algorithm. There are various approaches to QSVM, some aim to accelerate computation assuming fault-tolerant quantum computers, while others aim to achieve higher expressive power assuming noisy, near-term devices. In this challenge, we will focus on the latter, and the details will be explained later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this implementation of QSVM, you will be able to make choices on how you want to compose your quantum model, in particular focusing on the quantum feature map. This is motivated by the tradeoff that a more complex feature map would have greater representation power but be more susceptible to noise, which could be especially critical when using noisy, near-term devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the concepts that appear in this challenge are explained in the 2021 Qiskit Global Summer School (QGSS). The materials and lecture videos are available, and it is recommended that you study them as well. Refer to the links in each part for the corresponding lectures.\n",

    "So far, you have learned how to implement binary classification with QSVM. Now, how can you scale it up to multi-class classification? There are two approaches to do so. One is the One-vs-Rest approach, and the other is the One-vs-One approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-vs-Rest: In this approach, multi-class classification is achieved by combining classifiers for each class that classifies the class as positive and the others as negative. Since one classifier is required for each class, the total number of classifiers required for N-class classification is N. The advantage is that fewer classifiers are needed, and the disadvantage is that the labels are likely to be imbalanced in each classification.\n",
    "2. One-vs-One: In this approach, multi-class classification is achieved by combining classifiers for each pair of two classes, where one is positive and the other is negative. Since one classifier is required for each label pair, the total number of classifiers required for N-class classification is N(N-1)/2. The advantage is that labels are less likely to be imbalanced in each classification, and the disadvantage is that the number of classifiers required is larger.\n",

    "Both approaches can be used to solve this problem, but here you will be given hints based on the One-vs-Rest approach. Please follow the hints to solve it.\n",
