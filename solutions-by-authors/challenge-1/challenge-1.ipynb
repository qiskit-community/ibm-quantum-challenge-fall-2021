    "The goal of portfolio optimization is to minimize risks (financial loss) and maximize returns (financial gain). But this process is not as simple as it may seem. Gaining high returns with little risk is indeed too good to be true. Risks and returns usually have a trade-off relationship which makes optmizing your portfolio a little more complicated. As Dr. Harry Markowitz states in his Moderbn Portfolio Theory he created in 1952,  \"risk is an inherrent part of higher reward.\""

    "Interestingly, our portfolio optimization problem can be solved as a ground state search of a Hamiltonian. You can think of a Hamiltonian as an energy function representing the total energy of a physical system we want to simulate such as a molecule or a magnet. The physical system can be further represented by a mathemetical model called an [**Ising model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) which gives us a framework to convert our binary variables into a so called spin up (+1) or spin down (-1) state. \n",
    "    \n",
    "When it comes to applyting the optimization algorithms, the algorithms usually require problems to satisfy certain criteria to be applicable. For example, variational algorithms such as VQE and QAOA can only be applied to [**Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization) problems, thus Qiskit provides converters to automatically map optimization problems to these different formats whenever possible.\n",

As we discussed earlier, we can reformulate the quadratic program as a ground state energy search to be solved by [**VQE**](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.algorithms.VQE.html) where the ground state corresponds to the optimal solution we are looking for.
